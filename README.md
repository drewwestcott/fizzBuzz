Swift Coding Challenge (Fizz Buzz)

## Problem
Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 

1 .For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
2. For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
3. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

## Coding Interviews
Fizz buzz (often spelled "FizzBuzz" in this context) has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers. Writing a program to output the first 100 FizzBuzz numbers is a trivial problem for any would-be computer programmer, so interviewers can easily sort out those with insufficient programming ability.
